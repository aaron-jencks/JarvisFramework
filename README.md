# JarvisFramework
This framework will provide all of the code and things you need to be able to deploy servers and connect to them using clients both on pc's and from mobile devices.

The server will host a kind of cloud computing host, allowing computers and phones to off-load their processing power onto the server.

All of the code on the server-side will run off of dll's except for the socket handler, and the code that can replace the dll's. This should allow for any and all of the software on the server to be overwritten, during operation.
